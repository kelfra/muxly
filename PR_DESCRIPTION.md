# Feature: Scheduler and Configuration Modules Implementation

## Overview
This PR implements two core components of the Muxly system:
1. **Scheduler Module**: A robust scheduling system with cron, webhook, and API-based job scheduling
2. **Configuration Module**: A flexible configuration system with validation, schema, and multi-format support

## Changes
- Added comprehensive scheduler implementation with three scheduling mechanisms
- Created configuration loading, validation, and schema support
- Added configuration models for all system components
- Created default and development configuration files
- Updated main application to integrate with the scheduler
- Updated project dependencies in Cargo.toml
- Added implementation plan and progress documentation

## Technical Details

### Scheduler Module
- Implemented cron-based scheduling with timezone support
- Added webhook triggers with signature validation
- Created RESTful API for job management
- Integrated all three scheduling methods into a unified system

### Configuration Module
- Added support for YAML, JSON, and TOML configuration files
- Implemented environment variable overrides
- Created validation system with detailed error reporting
- Added JSON Schema for documentation and validation
- Implemented strongly typed configuration models for all components

## Testing
- Unit tests for both modules
- Integration tests for scheduler API endpoints
- Configuration validation tests

## Documentation
- Updated implementation plan
- Added progress summary
- Added inline documentation for all public APIs

## Known Issues
- There are compile errors in several modules that reference API routes and handlers not yet implemented
- Some middleware implementations need updating to match the latest Axum version
- The main application has references to components that will be implemented in future PRs
- These issues will be addressed in subsequent PRs as we implement the remaining modules

## Next Steps
The next phase will focus on implementing the Connectors Module for data source integration.
