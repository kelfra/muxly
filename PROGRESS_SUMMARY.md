# Muxly Implementation Progress Summary

## Completed Components

### 1. Scheduler Module
We have implemented a robust scheduling system with three complementary mechanisms:

- **Cron Scheduler**: Time-based scheduling using cron expressions with timezone support
- **Webhook Scheduler**: Event-driven scheduling triggered by HTTP webhooks with signature validation
- **API Scheduler**: RESTful API for programmatic job management

The scheduler module includes:
- A unified integration point via `SchedulerIntegration` class
- Configuration system for all scheduler types
- Proper error handling and logging
- Clear API documentation

### 2. Configuration Module
We've built a comprehensive configuration system that supports:

- Multiple file formats (YAML, JSON, TOML)
- Environment variable overrides
- Validation with detailed error reporting
- JSON Schema for documentation and validation
- Default configuration values
- Strongly typed configuration models

## Next Steps

Based on the implementation plan, our next priorities are:

### 1. Connectors Module
The connectors module will allow Muxly to integrate with various data sources:

- **BigQuery Connector**: For extracting data from Google BigQuery
- **GA4 Connector**: For fetching metrics from Google Analytics 4
- **HubSpot Connector**: For CRM data synchronization
- **Custom Connectors**: Via a plugin system for extensibility

### 2. Router Module
The router module will handle the delivery of data to various destinations:

- **Prometheus Output**: For metrics and monitoring
- **Webhook Output**: For sending data to HTTP endpoints
- **File Output**: For local storage in various formats
- **S3 Output**: For cloud storage
- **Database Output**: For SQL database persistence
- **Slack Notifications**: For alerting and notifications

### 3. Database Migrations
We need to implement database schema migrations for persistent storage of:

- Configuration data
- Connector definitions
- Job schedules and history
- User authentication and authorization

## Integration Strategy

The components we've built form a solid foundation for the complete system:

1. The **Scheduler Module** provides the execution framework for both connectors (data fetching) and routers (data delivery)
2. The **Configuration Module** enables flexible configuration of all system components

As we implement the connectors and router modules, we'll leverage these existing components:

- Using the configuration system for connector and router settings
- Using the scheduler to trigger connector syncs and router deliveries
- Maintaining the same error handling patterns and API design

## Timeline Update

Our progress is on track with the original implementation plan. We have:

- Completed the core scheduler module
- Completed the configuration system
- Created example configuration files
- Updated the project structure

The next phase will focus on implementing the connectors module, which is estimated to take 3-4 weeks.
