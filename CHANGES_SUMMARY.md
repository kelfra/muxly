# Changes Summary - Connectors Module Implementation

## Key Files

### Infrastructure Files

1. `src/connectors/mod.rs`
   - Exports all connector modules and public interfaces
   - Provides a unified entry point for connector functionality

2. `src/connectors/base.rs`
   - Defines the `Connector` trait that all connectors must implement
   - Implements common data structures: `ConnectorSettings`, `AuthSettings`, etc.
   - Provides the `create_connector` factory function to instantiate connectors

### Connector Implementations

3. `src/connectors/bigquery.rs`
   - Implements the BigQuery connector for Google BigQuery integration
   - Handles Google Cloud authentication and token management
   - Provides SQL query execution with parameter support
   - Transforms query results into a standardized format

4. `src/connectors/ga4.rs`
   - Implements the GA4 connector for Google Analytics 4 integration
   - Manages OAuth authentication flow with token refreshing
   - Provides report generation with dimensions and metrics
   - Handles data sampling and pagination

5. `src/connectors/hubspot.rs`
   - Implements the HubSpot connector for CRM data integration
   - Supports both OAuth and API key authentication
   - Provides access to contacts, companies, deals, and other CRM objects
   - Handles object associations and relationship management

### Plugin System

6. `src/connectors/plugin.rs`
   - Implements the plugin system for custom connector extensions
   - Provides dynamic loading of connector libraries at runtime
   - Defines a stable API for third-party developers
   - Includes an example plugin implementation

### Configuration & Documentation

7. `docs/project_status.md`
   - Updated to reflect the completion of the Connectors Module
   - Documents progress on project milestones and next steps

8. `Cargo.toml`
   - Added new dependencies for connector implementations:
     - `gcp_auth` for Google Cloud authentication
     - `libloading` for plugin system
     - `oauth2` for OAuth implementation
     - Supporting libraries for HTTP and data handling

## Implementation Details

### Connector Interface

All connectors implement the `Connector` trait, which provides a standard interface:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Connector {
    fn get_type(&self) -> &str;
    fn get_id(&self) -> &str;
    async fn initialize(&mut self, settings: ConnectorSettings) -> Result<()>;
    async fn test_connection(&self) -> Result<ConnectionStatus>;
    async fn fetch_data(&self, params: Value) -> Result<ConnectorData>;
    async fn get_metadata(&self) -> Result<Value>;
    fn get_configuration_template(&self) -> Value;
}
```

### Authentication Support

The system supports multiple authentication methods:

- **OAuth**: For GA4 and HubSpot with token refresh
- **Service Account**: For Google Cloud services
- **API Key**: For simpler authentication flows
- **Custom Authentication**: Via plugin extensions

### Data Transformation

Each connector is responsible for transforming source-specific data formats into a standardized `ConnectorData` structure:

```rust
pub struct ConnectorData {
    pub connector_id: String,
    pub timestamp: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
    pub data: Value,
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, Value>,
}
```

### Plugin System

The plugin system enables custom connectors through a stable API:

1. Plugin authors implement the `PluginConnector` trait
2. The `export_connector!` macro exposes the connector to the host application
3. The `PluginConnector` wrapper loads and manages the plugin lifecycle

## Extensibility

The system is designed to be extensible:
- New connector types can be added with minimal changes to the core codebase
- The plugin system allows for third-party extensions without modifying the source
- The connector interface is stable and backward-compatible for future additions
